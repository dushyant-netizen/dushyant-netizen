### Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making contributing to open-source more approachable, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, and Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup). I'm a self-taught passionate FrontEnd developer from India.

🚀 About Me

🎓 I am Dushyant Verma, a Front End Web Developer (specializing in React Applications) and a Top Rated Freelancer on Upwork. I'm a self-taught passionate FrontEnd developer from India.

👨‍💻 I enjoy contributing to Open Source Projects and have contributed to several Gigantic Organizations including, Material UI, Microsoft, Amazon, Webhint, and countless others. I am really enthusiastic about learning new technology. In 2021, I learned Next.js, Progressive Web App (PWA), GraphQL, Micro-Frontend Architecture, and Blockchain development & DApps. I got started with Freelancing and Blogging quite recently and made a name for myself.

🎸 Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. My hobbies range from guitar, break dancing (hip-hop), sketching, and touch typing to some whacky ones like writing with my left hand.

📚 I also love reading books on personal development & financial literacy. My favorite ones are The Compound Effect by Darren Hardy in the genre of personal development.

✈️ I love traveling too.
